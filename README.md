*Ext.ux.panel.RegionTool*

This panel plugin is based on ExtJS Kitchen Sink example. I made it into panel plugin so anyone can easily add it into their app. Plugin can be added into any panel, which is in border layout.  

The plugin adds 'gear' icon into a panel header, which user can use to dynamically change region of the panel in border layout.

Add to panel as plugins property: 
`plugins  : ["regiontool"]`
